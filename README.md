My implementation of the board game [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)).
This is a submission for an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-mastermind)

The player takes turns trying to break a code that the computer generates and coming up with a code for the computer to break.
The winner is the one with the highest total score after all rounds have been played.

## Setup

From the root directory:
1. Install gems: `bundle install`
2. Run game: `bundle exec ruby main.rb`

## Gameplay
Crack the computer's code:
